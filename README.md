# Medical Insurance Fraud Detection System 🌟

This project is a **Medical Insurance Fraud Detection System** implemented as a web application. The system leverages **machine learning models**, including **XGBoost**, to identify fraudulent claims and provides an intuitive interface for real-time fraud detection. The application is developed using **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Jupyter Notebook**, with a structured backend and frontend framework.

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes XGBoost for fraud detection with pre-trained models.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built using Flask and customizable templates.
- **Data Handling**: Supports CSV and Excel files for claim processing.
- **Visualization**: Provides analytical insights and visualizations for detected fraud patterns.
- **Dynamic Reports**: Offers detailed claim evaluations for better decision-making.
