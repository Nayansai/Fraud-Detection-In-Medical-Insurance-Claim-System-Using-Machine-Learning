# Medical Insurance Fraud Detection System 🌟

This project is a **Medical Insurance Fraud Detection System** implemented as a web application. The system leverages **machine learning models**, including **XGBoost**, to identify fraudulent claims and provides an intuitive interface for real-time fraud detection. The application is developed using **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Jupyter Notebook**, with a structured backend and frontend framework.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes XGBoost for fraud detection with pre-trained models.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built using Flask and customizable templates.
- **Data Handling**: Supports CSV and Excel files for claim processing.
- **Visualization**: Provides analytical insights and visualizations for detected fraud patterns.
- **Dynamic Reports**: Offers detailed claim evaluations for better decision-making.

- ## ⚙️ Machine Learning Model
The system employs **XGBoost**, a robust gradient-boosting algorithm, for detecting fraudulent claims. Key highlights:

- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used for evaluating model performance.
- **Optimization**: The model is fine-tuned for optimal performance using hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 🎨 Frontend
The frontend is designed to ensure a seamless user experience:

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for layouts and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the application.
- **Static Files**: Assets like CSS, JS, and images are stored in the `static/` folder.
- **Templates**: Dynamic HTML templates are stored in the `templates/` folder.

---

## 💻 Backend
The backend is powered by **Flask**, enabling:

- **File Uploads**: Supports uploading `.csv` and `.xlsx` files for analysis.
- **Predictions**: Utilizes the trained XGBoost model to predict fraudulent claims.
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Automatically flags suspicious claims and generates dynamic reports.

---

## 🧪 Usage
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Upload a claim file (`.csv` or `.xlsx`).
3. The system will analyze the claims and highlight potential fraud.
4. Download detailed analysis reports for further investigation.
