## üìä **Dataset**

- **The project uses the following datasets:**
- **Train-1542865627584.csv**: Dataset used to train the fraud detection model.
- **Testfile.xlsx** and **Train_Beneficiarydata(Test).xlsx**: Test datasets for validation purposes.
- **xgboost_model.pkl**: Pre-trained XGBoost model for fraud detection.

---

- ## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Model
The system employs **XGBoost**, a robust gradient-boosting algorithm, for detecting fraudulent claims. Key highlights:

- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used for evaluating model performance.
- **Optimization**: The model is fine-tuned for optimal performance using hyperparameter tuning.

---

## üé® Frontend
The frontend is designed to ensure a seamless user experience:

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for layouts and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the application.
- **Static Files**: Assets like CSS, JS, and images are stored in the `static/` folder.
- **Templates**: Dynamic HTML templates are stored in the `templates/` folder.

---

## üíª Backend
The backend is powered by **Flask**, enabling:

- **File Uploads**: Supports uploading `.csv` and `.xlsx` files for analysis.
- **Predictions**: Utilizes the trained XGBoost model to predict fraudulent claims.
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Automatically flags suspicious claims and generates dynamic reports.

---

## üß™ Usage
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Upload a claim file (`.csv` or `.xlsx`).
3. The system will analyze the claims and highlight potential fraud.
4. Download detailed analysis reports for further investigation.
